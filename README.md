# Geometric-Transformations
This project demonstrates geometric transformations on images using OpenCV. It applies Euclidean, Similarity, Affine, and Projective transformations to show how rotation, scaling, translation, and perspective changes affect images. The notebook provides clear visual comparisons to make the concepts easier to understand.
